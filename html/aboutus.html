Yoga  is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. <br>
There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals[2] in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.<br>
 Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and Rāja yoga.<br>

The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, <br>
but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. <br>
The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads.<br>
 The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, <br>
 but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century.<br> 
 Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.<br>

Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west, <br>
following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century.<br>
 In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world.<br>
 Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core.<br>
One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics,<br>
 and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy.<br>

Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention <br>
for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma, and heart disease.<br>
 The results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive, with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness,<br>
  and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient's psychological healing process. <br>
  On December 1, 2016, yoga was listed as UNESCO's Intangible cultural heritage.<br>
